                The mandatory "first-keystroke" attribute specifies the first keystroke of the action. The key strokes are specified according to the regular Swing rules.
                The optional "second-keystroke" attribute specifies the second keystroke of the action.
                The mandatory "keymap" attribute specifies the keymap for which the action is active. IDs of the standard keymaps are defined as
                constants in the com.intellij.openapi.keymap.KeymapManager class. -->

                The mandatory "keystroke" attribute specifies the clicks and modifiers for the action. It is defined as a sequence of words separated by spaces:
                "button1", "button2", "button3" for the mouse buttons; "shift", "control", "meta", "alt", "altGraph" for the modifier keys;
                "doubleClick" if the action is activated by a double-click of the button.
                The mandatory "keymap" attribute specifies the keymap for which the action is active. IDs of the standard keymaps are defined as
                constants in the com.intellij.openapi.keymap.KeymapManager class. -->

                The mandatory "group-id" attribute specifies the ID of the group to which the action is added.
                The group must be implemented by an instance of the DefaultActionGroup class.
                The mandatory "anchor" attribute specifies the position of the action in the group relative to other actions. It can have the values
                "first", "last", "before" and "after".
                The "relative-to-action" attribute is mandatory if the anchor is set to "before" and "after", and specifies the action before or after which
                the current action is inserted. -->
